# Connecting a conveyor belt device  
Create a basic conveyor belt with an IoT device that sends monitoring data to Watson IoT Platform on Bluemix

## Overview and goal

This guide steps you through the process of connecting devices to  Watson IoT Platform, monitoring and acting on device data

We set up a connected conveyor belt and use it to send IoT data to Watson IoT Platform. Depending on your skill level, you can follow one or both of the following paths to set up your conveyor belt:
* Path A  
This path gets you started quickly by installing a conveyor belt simulator app on Bluemix. The app self-registers a device with Watson IoT Platform and automatically sends well-formatted data to the platform. Instructions for this path are in [Step 2A - Use the simulator sample app from GitHub](#step-2a---deploy-the-sample-conveyor-belt-web-application).  
* Path B  
This path is technically more challenging and requires additional hardware, Python programming skills, and manual registration of your device with Watson IoT Platform. Instructions for this path are in  [Step 2B - Build a physical conveyor belt with a Raspberry Pi and an electric motor](#step-2b---build-a-raspberry-pi-powered-conveyor-belt).

As part of this guide, you will:
- Create and deploy a Watson IoT Platform organization by using Cloud Foundry CLI.
- Build and deploy a sample conveyor belt device.
- Connect the simulated conveyor belt device to Watson IoT Platform.
- Monitor and visualize device data by using the Watson IoT Platform dashboards.

> To get started with Watson IoT Platform using a different IoT device, see the [Getting started tutorial](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-iotp).

[![Create Toolchain](https://github.com/IBM/container-journey-template/blob/master/images/button.png)](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy/?repository=https://github.com/IBM/Create-basic-conveyor-belt-using-IoTdevice)

After deploying the application, please continue with [Step 3 - See raw data in Watson IoT Platform](#step-3---see-raw-data-in-watson-iot-platform).

## Steps
* [Deploy Watson IoT Platform](#step-1----deploy-watson-iot-platform)
* Do one of the following 2 steps:
** [Deploy the sample conveyor belt web application](#step-2a---deploy-the-sample-conveyor-belt-web-application) 
** [Build a Raspberry Pi-powered conveyor belt](#step-2b---build-a-raspberry-pi-powered-conveyor-belt)
* [See raw data in Watson IoT Platform](#step-3---see-raw-data-in-watson-iot-platform)
* [Visualize live data in Watson IoT Platform](#step-4---visualize-live-data-in-watson-iot-platform)

## Step 1 -  Deploy Watson IoT Platform

> Watson IoT Platform provides powerful application access to IoT devices and data to help you rapidly compose analytics applications, visualization dashboards, and mobile IoT apps. The steps that follow will deploy an instance of the Watson IoT Platform service with the name `iotp-for-conveyor` in your Bluemix environment. If you already have a service instance running, you can use that instance with the guide and skip this first step. Just make sure that you use the correct service name and Bluemix space when you proceed through the guides.

1. From the command line, set your API endpoint by running the cf api command.   
Replace the `API-ENDPOINT` value with the API endpoint for your region.
```
bx api <API-ENDPOINT>
```
Example: `bx api https://api.ng.bluemix.net`
<table>
<tr>
<th>Region</th>
<th>API Endpoint</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>US South</td>
<td>https://api.ng.bluemix.net</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>United Kingdom</td>
<td>https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net</td>
</tr>
</table>

2. Log into your Bluemix account.
```
bx login
```
If prompted, select the organization and space where you want to deploy Watson IoT Platform and the sample app. **Note** example a) org: lbenn@us.ibm.com  b) space = dev

3. Deploy the Watson IoT Platform service to Bluemix.
```    
bx cf create-service iotf-service iotf-service-free YOUR_IOT_PLATFORM_NAME
```

For YOUR_IOT_PLATFORM_NAME, use *iotp-for-conveyor*.  
Example: `bx cf create-service iotf-service iotf-service-free iotp-for-conveyor`

Next, you will create a sample conveyor belt device. Choose which path you want to take: 
 - Path A: [Step 2A - Use the simulator sample app from GitHub](#step-2a---deploy-the-sample-conveyor-belt-web-application).  
 - Path B: [Step 2B - Build a physical conveyor belt with a Raspberry Pi and an electric motor](#step-2b---build-a-raspberry-pi-powered-conveyor-belt).  

## Step 2A - Deploy the sample conveyor belt web application  

The sample app lets you simulate a Bluemix connected industrial conveyor belt. You can start and stop the belt and adjust the speed of the belt. Every change to the belt is sent to Bluemix in the form of an MQTT message that is displayed in the app. You can monitor the belt behavior by using the default dashboard cards. The sample app is built using the Node.js client libraries at: [https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-nodejs](https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-nodejs)

![Conveyor belt app](images/app_conveyor_belt.png)

* Use your favorite git tool to clone the following repository: [https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/guide-conveyor-simulator](https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/guide-conveyor-simulator).
In Git shell, use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/guide-conveyor-simulator
```

* On the command line, change the directory to the directory in which the sample app is located.
```bash
cd guide-conveyor-simulator
```

* From the *guide-conveyor-simulator* directory, push your app to Bluemix and give it a new name by replacing YOUR_APP_NAME in the cf push command. Use the --no-start option because you will start the app in the next stage after it is bound to Watson IoT Platform.
> Note: Deploying your application can take a few minutes.

```bash
bx cf push YOUR_APP_NAME --no-start
```  

* In the *guide-conveyor-simulator* directory, bind your app to your instance of the Watson IoT Platform by using the names that you provided for each.
```bash
bx cf bind-service YOUR_APP_NAME iotp-for-conveyor
```
>For more information about binding applications, see [Connecting applications](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/platform_authorization.html#bluemix-binding).

* Start your application for the binding to take effect.
```bash
bx cf start YOUR_APP_NAME
```
At this stage, your sample web application is deployed on Bluemix. When deployment is completed, a message is displayed to indicate that your app is running.
Example:
```bash
name:              YOUR_APP_NAME
requested state:   started
instances:         1/1
usage:             64M x 1 instances

```

To see both the app deployment status and the app URL, you can run the following command:
```bash
bx cf apps
```
> Troubleshoot errors in the deployment process by using the `bx cf logs YOUR_APP_NAME --recent` command.

* In a browser, access the app.  
Open the following URL: `https://YOUR_APP_NAME.mybluemix.net`    
Example: `https://conveyorbelt.mybluemix.net/`.

* Enter a device ID and token for your device.  
The sample app automatically registers a device of type `iot-conveyor-belt` with the device ID (e.g. my-first-device) and token that you provided. For more information about registering devices, see [Connecting devices](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/iotplatform_task.html#iotplatform_subtask1).
4. Continue with [Step 3 - See raw data in Watson IoT Platform](#step-3---see-raw-data-in-watson-iot-platform).
